Description: An R Commander plug-in providing an integrated solution to perform
    a series of text mining tasks such as importing and cleaning a corpus, and
    analyses like terms and documents counts, vocabulary tables, terms
    co-occurrences and documents similarity measures, time series analysis,
    correspondence analysis and hierarchical clustering. Corpora can be imported
    from spreadsheet-like files, directories of raw text files, Twitter queries,
    as well as from Dow Jones Factiva, LexisNexis, Europresse and Alceste files.
